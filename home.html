              I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for all things
              tech related. I find the world of programming to be extremely
              intriguing, and I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and
              skills in this field. Considering the rate at which technology
              advances and new programming languages are developed, learning
              within this field is perpetual. I am particularly interested in
              web development, and I enjoy creating dynamic and interactive
              websites. In my free time, I like to work on personal projects,
              explore new technologies, and contribute to open-source
              initiatives.

            <p id="hobbies-text">
              My personal interests are the polar opposite of my professional
              interests. I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking, and exploring
              nature. I've found that letting all the noise throughout the day
              fade away while encapsulated in nature presents a mental clarity
              that is hard to replicate. I also enjoy reading, particularly
              books on psychoanalysis and philosophy. I find that these subjects
              provide a unique perspective on the human experience and help me
              understand myself and others better.
